You have entered a dark, low cave that seems to lead to a slightly larger cavern to the north. 
You can go NORTH.

You have entered the cavern, you see a torch on the floor.Then you hear a river to your East.You can go EAST.



You have found the river and you hear a swarm of bug coming for the west.You can follow the river down stream or you can go towards the light coming from the north.You can go NORTH or SOUTH.
  





You followed the river down stream and you found a waterfall.The only ways of getting down from the waterfall is to either jump or take the pathway to your wast. You decide that taking the path would be safer.You can go WAST.




You have been walking on the path for a while now and you don't see the end of it. So you decide to climb down the mountain. You can go DOWN. 



Congratulations!!!You have made it out of the cavern. Would you like to exit? enter x.
